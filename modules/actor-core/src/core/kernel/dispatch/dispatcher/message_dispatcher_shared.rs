//! AShared wrapper around `Box<dyn MessageDispatcher>`.
//!
//! `MessageDispatcherShared` is the only legal way to share a concrete
//! [`MessageDispatcher`] across actor cells, dispatcher registries, and
//! callers. It owns the `SpinSyncMutex` so trait commands always run under
//! `&mut self`, and it exposes the lifecycle and dispatch orchestration that
//! must execute outside the lock (executor submission, delayed shutdown
//! registration, etc.).
